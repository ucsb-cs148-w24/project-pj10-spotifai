- Purpose of the project:
The purpose of our feature-rich app is to elevate the music experience with visuals and other convenience features. It incorporates an innovative "Generate AI Playlist Cover" button that leverages song characteristics to create personalized covers using advanced DALL-E technology. The app goes beyond traditional dashboards by offering customization options, including personalized color schemes, and a "Find on YouTube" feature for convenient video searches related to selected songs. The pop-up sidebar reveals demographic insights into listeners' locations and includes a beat visualizer with full-screen capabilities, synchronized animations based on song tempo, and lyric analysis or genre graphics tailored to lyrical or non-lyrical songs. Users can sort playlists by danceability, energy, and valence, while an intriguing feature allows song generation based on images, adding a visual dimension to music curation. The app caters to social media enthusiasts by generating Instagram story-like covers.
