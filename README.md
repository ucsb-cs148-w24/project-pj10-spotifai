# SpotifAI: Spotify, but better ðŸŽµâœ¨
This dashboard app is a feature-rich platform designed to elevate the music experience. It incorporates an innovative "Generate AI Playlist Cover" button that leverages song characteristics to create personalized covers using advanced DALL-E technology. The app goes beyond traditional dashboards by offering customization options, including personalized color schemes, and a "Find on YouTube" feature for convenient video searches related to selected songs. The pop-up sidebar reveals demographic insights into listeners' locations and includes a beat visualizer with full-screen capabilities, synchronized animations based on song tempo, and lyric analysis or genre graphics tailored to lyrical or non-lyrical songs.

TLDR: SpotifAI is an innovative dashboard app that enhances the music experience with personalized playlist covers, customizable features, YouTube MV integration, demographic insights, and a beat visualizer.
