SpotifAI is an innovative dashboard app that enhances the music experience with personalized playlist covers, customizable features, demographic insights, beat visualizers, and social media-friendly Instagram story-like covers.

Project Description: The dashboard app under development is a feature-rich platform designed to elevate the music experience. It incorporates an innovative "Generate AI Playlist Cover" button that leverages song characteristics to create personalized covers using advanced DALL-E technology. The app goes beyond traditional dashboards by offering customization options, including personalized color schemes, and a "Find on YouTube" feature for convenient video searches related to selected songs. The pop-up sidebar reveals demographic insights into listeners' locations and includes a beat visualizer with full-screen capabilities, synchronized animations based on song tempo, and lyric analysis or genre graphics tailored to lyrical or non-lyrical songs. Users can sort playlists by danceability, energy, and valence, while an intriguing feature allows song generation based on images, adding a visual dimension to music curation. The app caters to social media enthusiasts by generating Instagram story-like covers.

User roles: Anyone curious can use our app and see the public information displayed in a helpful/captivating format.

Roles and Permissions: Anyone can access our site, as there is no ability to put inflammatory content/hack users/etc. via our site format.
