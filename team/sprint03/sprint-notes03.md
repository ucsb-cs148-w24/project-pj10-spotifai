Sprint03

agenda:
* is there any changes to ethan's design
    * ANSWER: NO
* wireframing it — sam will write the div boxes
    * (FINISHED)
* is there an advantage of using figma to create the wireframe/template and just export it (is it faster? is it neater? etc.) 
    * no this is a bad idea
    * Lindsey and sam both had bad experiences with the exporting of react directly, so we will just code it up from scratch
* allocating each block to a person (do ur best to put in dummy data)
    * beat visualizer: kyle, grace
    * ai generated cover: lindsey
    * playlists: richard
    * current song: aaron
    * demographic info: sam + lindsey?
    * lyric analysis: ethan
* goal by friday — get the mvp done/significantly close
