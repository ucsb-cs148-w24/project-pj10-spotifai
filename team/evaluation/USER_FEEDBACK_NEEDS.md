2. Thoughts on how easy our overall project was to use and what ways we can improve it in, such as in the user interface to make it more user-friendly.
3. Ideas on what other features you'd like to see. Currently, we have a playlist cover generator, links to Youtube videos of the song, and demographic information of the song based on Google Trends.
