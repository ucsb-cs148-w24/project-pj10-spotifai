Sprint planning:
- During our sprint our goals are to make sure we get our kanban set up and get everyone a task on the kanban board
- We also want to solidify our tech stack during our meeting
- We will get a more concrete idea of what our final product will look like
- Start getting our UI built up and solidify who is using what tech

Stories we want to deliver:
- The main story we want to deliver is the story of a user getting to our page and seeing an UI with different sections for information. Basically, our user should be able to see the places where information will be and move around our page.
