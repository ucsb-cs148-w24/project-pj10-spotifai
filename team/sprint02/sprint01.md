Story we want to deliver:
- The main story we want to deliver is the story of a user getting to our page and seeing an UI with different sections for information. Basically, our user should be able to see the places where information will be and move around our page.

How will we do it?
- Make sure we get our kanban set up and get everyone a task on the kanban board along with getting one to finished
- We will solidify our tech stack and designate who will use which tech and how they will implement their tech into the product
- We will get a more concrete idea of what our final product will look like such as how the user will interact and what we can add so that the user has the most satisfaction
- Start getting our UI built up and organizing the visuals of our page
