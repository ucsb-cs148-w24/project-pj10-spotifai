# Feedback Grouped and Sorted
## Pros:
 - good creative idea
 - very aesthetic UI (to be fair it is basically spotify's)
 - they very clearly understood what the app was meant to do

## Cons: 
 - some of the features do not do anything new or transformative on spotify
 - cover ai generation is rigid â€” there should be a way to either generate different playlist options per cover or introduce some sort of noise/entropy between generations
 - find a way to save the image to desktop
 - a lot of people were excited for aspects like beat visualizer or the listener map but they were not done

# Response Actions
 - the UI doesn't need much changing, but we just need to make sure that everything else that we add is well placed and looks polished
 - we might try to find a way to ai generate with noise/some change in the dall-e prompts
 - we need to keep in mind some quality of life items, i.e. being able to save images
    
# Next Steps
 - when the components are coded, make sure that they are flexible in position just so the UI is adjustable in later stages
 - the ai team is going to experiment with prompts including the lyrics as well as possibly user input
 - we will compile a list of quality of life items that can be included after the big components are nearing finished
 - for the aspects that arent done, work on them will resume as per usual
