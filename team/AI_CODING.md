Coding with AI:

Aaron: Using codeium

Samuel: I used Github Copilot. Copilot was incredibly useful because it allowed me to very quickly write boiler plate lines of code by repeatedly hitting tab and enter, and it was correct most of the time. The nice thing about Copilot was that you don't have to think about it— you can just see the suggestion automatically and reject it if it is not what you want. Very often, I used Copilot to navigate coding a program that I was not sure exactly was correct, and I could just run it and maybe adjust it accordingly untit it worked.

Kyle: I used ChatGPT. I asked GPT to help explain what one of the React project files did and also asked it to explain some React documentation to me. It was actually very useful and in depth. It broke down the file into different components and explained specifically what each component did and how. Interestingly, it was also able to explain what APIs each component used and was able to infer what the purpose of functions and methods were. To ensure that the AI output was correct I could manually check the documentation for React and see if it's explanation was correct. For the React filw which I asked it to explain, I could see that it was accurate by the fact that it actually accurately described each function in the file. 

Lindsey: I experimented with Vercel v0.dev after seeing it being demoed in class. This tool seems really interesting and helpful for prototyping our UI and simple componenets where it may be better to generate it rather than coding it up. I asked it to generate a dashboard similar to the Spotify home page and the AI output was better than I expected. The steps I took to ensure that the output was more accurate was by copying the generated code and making small modifications to fit what I was looking for. It also gives pretty good inspiration as to how we can improve the layout of our project to be more aesthetically pleasing.

Ethan: This week I used Github Copilot for the first time. It was easy to set up and after intergrating it with VSCode, and I experimented with it by writing small sections of code and testing the tab autocomplete feature that Copilot provides. It was interesting and very useful as it could predict what I wanted to write or reference previous code so that writing new lines was so much more efficient. Most of the time the autofill generated was correct, but there were a few occasions in which the feature distracted me and led me astray from what I actually wanted to do. However, some experimentation and thinking through the debugging was enough to fix it. Overall, I think I will definitely continue to use it in the future when coding as a tool to expedite whatever I need to work on.
