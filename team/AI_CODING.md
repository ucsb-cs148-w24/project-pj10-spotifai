Coding with AI:

Aaron: Using codeium

Samuel: I used Github Copilot. Copilot was incredibly useful because it allowed me to very quickly write boiler plate lines of code by repeatedly hitting tab and enter, and it was correct most of the time. The nice thing about Copilot was that you don't have to think about itâ€” you can just see the suggestion automatically and reject it if it is not what you want. Very often, I used Copilot to navigate coding a program that I was not sure exactly was correct, and I could just run it and maybe adjust it accordingly untit it worked.

Kyle: I used ChatGPT. I asked GPT to help explain what one of the React project files did and also asked it to explain some React documentation to me. It was actually very useful and in depth. It broke down the file into different components and explained specifically what each component did and how. Interestingly, it was also able to explain what APIs each component used and was able to infer what the purpose of functions and methods were. To ensure that the AI output was correct I could manually check the documentation for React and see if it's explanation was correct. For the React filw which I asked it to explain, I could see that it was accurate by the fact that it actually accurately described each function in the file.
