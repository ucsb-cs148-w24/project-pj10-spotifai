Coding with AI:

Aaron: Using codeium
Samuel: I used Github Copilot. Copilot was incredibly useful because it allowed me to very quickly write boiler plate lines of code by repeatedly hitting tab and enter, and it was correct most of the time. The nice thing about Copilot was that you don't have to think about itâ€” you can just see the suggestion automatically and reject it if it is not what you want. Very often, I used Copilot to navigate coding a program that I was not sure exactly was correct, and I could just run it and maybe adjust it accordingly untit it worked.
