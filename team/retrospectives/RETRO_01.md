# Date of Retrospective: 1/26/2024

* Led by: Richard Fang
* Present: Everyone
* Absent: None

## Action item
* a goal: improve coordination of the team and division of work to reach target deliverables
* a change/experiment: add additional weekend meeting on Sunday and additional communication besides scrum meetings and updating each other more often
* a measurement: log additional meetings and give reflections on productivity and communication (rating 1-10 from each team member)

## Retro notes

Start/Stop/Continue Framework

Start:
- more scrum meetings: additional scrum meeting scheduled for Saturday 3 PM
- more communications on discord even between scrum meetings
- decide on a design and work out React UI
- whiteboarding for frontened layout and work flow chart
- more specific goals and targets to hit with specified deadlines
- reaching out more if facing a bottleneck or problems in development

Stop:
- working on D3 framework or future work before the other parts are caught up
- having unorganized meetings without a clear agenda
- nonresponse on discord and/or slack

Continue:
- being present and on time at all the meetings (perfect attendance so far)
- interacting and posting updates through discord
- updating and staying up to date with the kanban board

## Retro assessment
* We used the the Start/Stop/Continue framework for this retro meeting
* The meeting went well, everyone participated and gave input that lead to our final points that we decided on. We overall felt that it was productive and helpful for our team to review and reflect.
* Advice for next leader: be prepared before meeting, have prompts to keep conversation going or points to lead discussion

## Experiment/Change
* Adding an additional scrum meeting on Sunday and more open discord communication
* The additional scrum meeting was very helpful to sort through everything we needed to do for the sprint and fully agree on the frontend design as well as where to continue from there. There was indeed an increase in Discord communications that helped everyone stay on the same page.
* A decision going forward: We would like to keep the change of the additional meeting since we all agreed it was hugely beneficial
