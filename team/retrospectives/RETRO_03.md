## Retro notes

Start/Stop/Continue Framework

Start:
- Debugging problems
- Unit testing each componoent
- Improving the accesablity of the project so it is easier to not only test but use
- Optimizing the project
- Using more AI tools to help us write and test our code
- Implimenting the recomendations we got fomr the mvp (a lot of our work right now is just immproving what we already have and getting it to work smoothly)

Stop:
- Procrastinating
- Pushing untested code to main
- Stop spending too much time on one task that is a lost cause (ex certain data that is too hard to find)

Continue:
- Using AI tools from the expriment we did this week
- Looking for new features
- Polishing up the features that we already have

## Retro assessment
* We used the the Start/Stop/Continue framework for this retro meeting
* The meeting was successful, with active participation from everyone leading to the final decisions of mainly just imporoving what we have and working on ease of use and acces. Overall, we found it productive and beneficial for our team to engage in review and reflection.
* Advice for next leader: be prepared before meeting, have prompts to keep conversation going or points to lead discussion

## Experiment/Change
* Working on the kanban and reporting what we are finishing and working on
* This structure was helpful in making sure that we could get tasks done, but one thing we noticed that people can get stuck on prusuits that could be too hard or fruitless (we want to stop doing this).
* A decision going forward: We would like to keep this system, but also add that if the task is too hard or if someone thinks it is not aiglined with our goals anymore we message or tell everyone duirng the meeting and either modify the goal or just delete it altogether
