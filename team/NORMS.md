List of Norms:
- Be on time.
- Please check Discord daily (preferably), Slack is for anything we run by mentors (to not clutter the Slack).
- Please message ahead if you will not be in class 24 hrs ahead.
- Do your best to get work done on time — this obviously isn't ever going to be perfect so at least ask for help/inform the group that you are experiencing a slowdown.
- This is not strictly comprehensive list, but I ask that each member be flexible to accommodate within the group for synergistic workflow — thanks y'all :)
