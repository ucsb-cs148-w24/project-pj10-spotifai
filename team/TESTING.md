- We aim to create unit tests for each component so that we can test each part of the project individually and better identify issues at their root
- We used Codeium to generate the base code for the unit tests and edit them to fit our needs
- Our test will test each event initiated in the component, test the relevant states used/changed in the component, and the efficacy of our API/backend calls
- We use the Jest library to write our tests (tried to use Enzyme as well but found Jest to be better in testing our API calls)
- We first implemented a unit test for the Login components that verifies the state of the user, verifies the API call token/user/etc, and verifies that the component is displaying properly
